# Lab 2: Project Planning {.unnumbered}

In this session we will begin the first project of the course: performing a correlational analysis using to ANES 2016 dataset. By the end of the session you will have a plan for your analysis.



## Goals

- Examine the ANES dataset
- Identify variables for your correlation analysis
- Search the literature to find relevant research
- Formulate a brief research proposal



## ANES data

The dataset we will use is from the 2016 election. The reason for using this (instead of a more recent one) is that the 2016 survey included a personality scale: the TIPI (Ten-item personality inventory: ). Its inclusion allow us to look at how the Big 5 personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism correlate with any of the other variables recorded in the survey.



## Finding relevant research


## Your hypothesis

Having chosen your variables and found some relevant research to inform your theoretical perspective about how the variables are (or aren't) associated, you should be able to articulate your *hypothesis*. This is a formal statement of your expectations about how the variables are associated, and it will be tested quantitatively by calculating a correlation statistic.




# Proposal

A brief (one-page or so) research proposal outlining:

- Your variables of interest (one should be one of the Big 5, the other any variable of your choosing)
- Your theoretical perspective
- Your expectations (this should follow from your theoretical perspective)
