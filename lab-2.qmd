# Lab 2: Project Planning {.unnumbered}

In this session we will begin the first project of the course: performing a correlational analysis using to ANES 2016 dataset. By the end of the session you will have a plan for your analysis.



## Goals

- Examine the ANES dataset
- Identify a variable for your correlation analysis
- Search the literature to find a relevant paper
- Formulate a brief research proposal



## ANES data

The dataset we will use is from the 2016 election. The reason for using this (instead of a more recent one) is that the 2016 survey included a personality scale: the TIPI (Ten-item personality inventory: ). Its inclusion allow us to look at how the Big 5 personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism correlate with any of the other variables recorded in the survey.



## Finding relevant research
