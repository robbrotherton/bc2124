    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance & timeliness\nIn-person attendance of each lab session is expected, except in emergencies. Normally it is departmental policy to remove students who miss more than two sessions from the course; however, given ongoing revisions to college-wide health-related policies, exceptions may be made. If you are feeling unwell, you should not come to class and notify me of nonattendance before class if possible. When you are attending, please arrive on time for class. Frequent lateness will impact your participation grade.\n\n\nAssignment deadlines & late policy\nAssignments are listed in the class schedule next to the class session to which they correspond. Most assignments are due at 5pm the day after class. All assignments relate to your project proposal—the idea is to build this major piece of work incrementally over the course of the semester. The 5pm next-day deadline is necessary to allow time to provide substantive feedback to everyone in advance of the next assignment.\nA grade penalty of 5 points will be applied for each day (or part thereof) that an assignment is late (up to a maximum of 6 days; work not submitted before the next lab will receive a score of zero). For example, if your work is A+ quality but is submitted a day-and-a-half late, you will only receive a B+. Due to time constraints, you may also not receive feedback on late work.\nThis policy is intended to incentivize timely submission while easing the stress of genuine emergencies. When things come up that prevent timely submission you can prioritize accordingly, knowing that a small penalty on one assignment for this lab will not tank your final grade.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nStudents are expected to follow the Barnard Honor Code, available at https://barnard.edu/honor-code.\nNote that even though you may collaborate in lab and on the research proposal, you may not collaborate on written assignments. You must write your own reports.\n\n\nAcademic accommodations and general wellness\nIt is always important to recognize the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. The faculty and administration recognize this, and are prepared to provide assistance to students in need. I encourage you to seek advice from your advisor, Dean, the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS), or Barnard Health & Wellness as needed. Please let me know of any issues you wish to share with me that you feel are impacting your ability to complete the course to the best of your ability. Though it isn’t always easy, it is better to proactively seek help rather than letting problems build up."

You’ll only need a few of those. So the first step is selecting out just the variables you need to work with.\nThere are a lot of ways to do this. The simplest would be to make a note of the variable IDs from the codebook and make a vector of the IDs. The c() function ‘collects’ things together, so you can use it to collect the variable IDs.\n\ntipi_vars <- c(\n    \"V162333\",\n    \"V162334\",\n    \"V162335\",\n    \"V162336\",\n    \"V162337\",\n    \"V162338\",\n    \"V162339\",\n    \"V162340\",\n    \"V162341\",\n    \"V162342\"\n)\n\nThat works perfectly fine, and is probably the most sensible approach here. But to give you a sense of the many different ways that you can achieve the same thing in R, here’s another way you could do it. This relies on the fact that the variable IDs are sequential; they are all prefixed by “V1623”, and then they run from “33” to “42”. So here I “paste” together that stem and that sequence of numbers, producing the same 10 variable IDs that I typed in manually before.\n\ntipi_vars <- paste0(\"V1623\", 33:42)\n\ntipi_vars\n\n [1] \"V162333\" \"V162334\" \"V162335\" \"V162336\" \"V162337\" \"V162338\" \"V162339\"\n [8] \"V162340\" \"V162341\" \"V162342\"\n\n\n\ntipi_data <- timeseries_2016 |> \n  select(all_of(tipi_vars)) \n\nThat’s it! Let’s see what this new subsetted data.frame looks like:\n\nhead(tipi_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  V162333    V162334    V162335  V162336 V162337 V162338 V162339 V162340 V162341\n  <hvn_lbll> <hvn_lbll> <hvn_lb> <hvn_l> <hvn_l> <hvn_l> <hvn_l> <hvn_l> <hvn_l>\n1 6          5          6        5       6       5       5       2       6      \n2 6          5          5        5       6       6       5       5       4      \n3 6          4          7        5       5       2       2       4       5      \n4 6          2          6        2       4       4       6       2       6      \n5 5          3          7        3       5       7       6       3       6      \n6 5          5          7        2       4       6       4       3       6      \n# ℹ 1 more variable: V162342 <hvn_lbll>\n\n\nAnd it all looks good so far. But if you inspect the data more extensively (click the name in your Environment and scroll down a bit) you’ll notice that there are some negative numbers in the data. That’s from survey codes which recode missing data. So we need to do some data cleaning to handle things like that.\n\n\nCleaning the data\nThere are a lot of different ways we could handle this. One way is to filter() the data, retaining only rows which meet certain conditions.\n\ntipi_data_complete <- tipi_data |>\n    filter(if_all(all_of(tipi_vars), ~ . %in% 1:7))\n\nAnother way would be to mutate() the data; that is, change certain values based on some condition.\n\ntipi_data_complete <- tipi_data |>\n    mutate(across(all_of(tipi_vars), ~case_when(\n        .x < 1 ~ NA,\n        TRUE ~ .x\n    )))\n\n\n\nComputing scale averages\nNow that the data is subsetted and recoded, the last thing to do is compute any new values. As an example, if you have a scale which has multiple questions asking about a particular construct, it is often necessary to compute an average score for each participant.\nThe TIPI has 10 questions in total, two for each of the Big 5 personality traits. So it may be desirable to compute a score for each of the 5 traits by averaging its two respective items.\nNotice, however, that for each of the 5 traits, one question is positively worded and one is negatively worded.\n\nreverse_vars <- \"V162333\"\n\ntipi_data_complete <- tipi_data_complete |>\n    mutate(across(all_of(reverse_vars), ~ 8 - .))\n\nNow we can go ahead and compute the averages, using mutate() to create new columns containing the rowMeans() (i.e. an average for each row) for the specified columns.\n\nopenness_vars <- c(\"V162333\", \"V162338\")\nextraversion_vars <- c(\"V162334\", \"V162339\")\n\nscale_mean <- function(vars) rowMeans(across(all_of(vars)))\n\ntipi_data_complete <- tipi_data_complete |>\n    mutate(openness_mean = scale_mean(openness_vars),\n           extraversion_mean = scale_mean(extraversion_vars))"

Two minutes is not a lot of time. Apparently, people speak at a rate of around 125 to 150 words per minute on average. So a 2-minute presentation will be no more than around 300 words. The single-slide, not-many-words format demands clarity, conciseness, and being bold to spark the audience’s interest in your topic.\nAvoid simply reading excerpts from your paper. That would be boring, and would probably take up too many words. Make it fun and interesting. Try to grab the audience’s attention and hit them with just the most important points of your ideas.\nYou will also have a single PowerPoint slide to accompany your presentation. Make it count. You can’t just cram a load of text on there, because nobody will be able to read it. Plus, it’d distract from what you’re saying. Make it a visual aid that somehow supports or clarifies what you’re saying. It might be a visual representation of your design, a key piece of your experimental stimuli, a graph of your expected results, or just a pertinent meme which conveys the motivation for your question.\nAfter your two-minute talk you’ll take a few questions from the audience, and your responsiveness will contribute toward your grade as well as the quality of your presentation itself (remember a perfectly acceptable answer if often: “Good question; I don’t know the answer!”). It’s not usually an issue, but just in case your audience is left speechless, I suggest coming with a couple of questions or thoughts of your own that you can throw at the audience to spark more questions.\nEach pair will be allotted five minutes total for their talk and Q&A. Going over time and/or failing to leave time for questions will impact your presentation grade. It is up to each pair to decide how to divide up the two-minute talk, and to practice to make sure the presentation is to time."

Overly general and your results might not be very useful.\n\nBrainstorm ideas and find vocabulary, synonyms, useful keywords to search.\nThink about whether it would help to put a phrase in quotation marks. E.g. googling attachment theory returns around 200 million results, whereas \"attachment theory\" returns around 3 million.\nThink about what combination(s) of keywords should narrow your results to the most relevant content.\nIt might help to use Boolean operators such as AND, OR, or to exclude certain keywords from your results, NOT (see https://guides.library.barnard.edu/boolean).\n\nNote that this will most likely be an ongoing process throughout your search; the results you find should help you tailor your keywords in an iterative process."

For common psychology terms or ideas, Google will often lead you to a helpful Wikipedia article. You’ll probably also see results from popular psychology websites like Psychology Today. You might also find there are books or blog posts relevant to your interests.\nSkimming some of these initial results can be a great way to quickly familiarize yourself with the big-picture ideas and some relevant research findings. But you should be aware that many of these kinds of resources will be nonscholarly. That’s not intended as an insult. It just means that they are written for a general audience. The vocabulary is less specialized, and they are not peer reviewed, and they do not always have citations and references.\nThe sources you cite in your proposal paper should be scholarly. Scholarly journals and books are written for specialized readership, by scholars or experts in a field of study, describing academic research. They are “peer reviewed” by other experts as a quality control mechanism; they have citations and references; they give the affiliation of the authors (university, research institution); and they have abstracts (in the sciences and social sciences)."

    "section": "Descriptive statistics",
    "text": "Descriptive statistics\nThe first step is to describe your data. These kinds of statistics are called descriptive statistics or summary statistics. With an experimental design where you want to compare groups, the most obvious place to start is to find an average value for the observations in a group. The average, or mean, is a measure of typical performance; it summarizes all the scores and produces a single number which represents the most typical value. The basic formula for the mean of a set of scores is:\n\\[\nM = \\dfrac{\\Sigma X}{n}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(X\\) refers to all the scores in the group, and n is the number of scores in the group. The symbol \\(\\Sigma\\) instructs you to sum all the scores. A simple way of saying the formula in words is: Add up all the scores in the group and divide by the number of scores in that group. If you experiment involves comparing two or more groups, you can obviously calculate the mean of each group of scores separately. If the means are different, maybe your experimental manipulation had an effect.\nHowever, there is always variability in the scores in a group. The mean is a central value, but some scores fall below it and others above it. Therefore, researchers also need to describe the amount of variability in scores. This puts the mean in context, describing just how representative of all the scores it is. If there is high variability, scores are spread widely and the mean is relatively unrepresentative; if there is low variability, scores are clustered tightly and the mean is relatively representative. When variability is high, the group means might be different just due to chance, not because of your experimental manipulation.\nA mathematical way of describing the amount of variability in a group of scores is to calculate the deviation of each score from the mean, square the deviations, and then sum the squared deviations. This quantity is called Sum of Squares (SS). One mathematical formula is:\n\\[\nSS = \\Sigma(X - M)^2\n\\]\nDividing SS by the number of scores in the group minus 1 produces a quantity called variance, which is represented by the symbol s2. Variance is the average squared deviation. (Remember that to calculate an average, you add a set of scores and divide by n. Here we add a set of deviations and divide by n – 1. We use n – 1, rather than just n, because it is a necessary statistical adjustment to account for the fact that samples tend to underestimate variability.)\n\\[\ns^2 = \\dfrac{\\Sigma(X-M)^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nTaking the square root of the variance produces another quantity, called standard deviation. It is represented mathematically by the symbol s, but in psychology papers you will most often see it represented by the letters SD.\n\\[\nSD = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\Sigma(X-M)^2}{n-1}}\n\\]\nWhile variance is the average squared deviation, SD is the average deviation in the original units (i.e. not squared). This is the most intuitive way to convey how much scores typically varied about the mean."

    "text": "Inferential statistics\nKnowing the standard deviation and mean for each experimental group gives you a good idea of how much scores differed within each group, and how much the groups differed on average. But researchers still need to perform a statistical test to determine whether the groups differed more than would be expected by chance alone. These kinds of statistical tests are called inferential statistics, because we are using our sample data to make an inference about what would happen if everyone in the population had taken part in our experiment, rather than just the small number of people who happened to be in our samples.\n\nCorrelation\nWhen you measure two variables and wish to know if scores on one measure are related to scores on the other, you calculate the correlation coefficient. This quantifies the extent to which changes on one measure are related to changes on the other. For example, if higher scores on measure X are associated with higher scores on measure Y, there is a positive correlation. If higher scores on measure X are associated with lower scores on measure Y, there is a negative correlation. No correlation means that scores on X are unrelated to scores on Y.\nTo calculate the correlation between two variables, you must first calculate the Sum Product, SP. The mathematical formula is:\n\\[\nSP = (X-M_X)(Y-M_Y)\n\\]\nNotice that \\(X - M_X\\) and \\(Y - M_Y\\) are deviation scores, just like we calculated for the standard deviation. Here we have two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), so the equation is telling us to calculate the deviation of each score from its respective mean. We then multiply each deviation for variable \\(X\\) by its counterpart deviation from variable \\(Y\\). These are the “products,” meaning multiplied deviation scores. Finally, the tells us to add up all those products, giving the “sum of products,” \\(SP\\).\nOnce we have calculated \\(SP\\), the correlation coefficient, symbolized by \\(r\\) is calculated using the following equation:\n\\[\nr = \\dfrac{SP}{\\sqrt{SS_X SS_Y}}\n\\]\nHere, \\(SS_X\\) and \\(SS_Y\\) are the Sums of Squares for each variable. Multiplying them and taking the square root gets us a measure of the variability in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) separately. The numerator, \\(SP\\), represents the covariability of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). So the equation results in covariability as a proportion of all variability. It can range from \\(-1\\), meaning a perfect negative correlation, to \\(0\\), meaning no correlation at all, to \\(+1\\), meaning a perfect positive correlation. As a rule of thumb, in psychology, correlations of less than around \\(\\pm 0.30\\) are considered weak, around \\(\\pm 0.30\\) to \\(\\pm 0.70\\) are considered moderate, and greater than around \\(\\pm 0.70\\) are considered large.\n\n\n\nThe \\(t\\)-test\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    df \n    t \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    12.706 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    4.303 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    3.182 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    2.776 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    2.571 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    2.447 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    2.365 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    2.306 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    2.262 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    2.228 \n  \n  \n    11 \n    2.201 \n  \n  \n    12 \n    2.179 \n  \n  \n    13 \n    2.160 \n  \n  \n    14 \n    2.145 \n  \n  \n    15 \n    2.131 \n  \n  \n    16 \n    2.120 \n  \n  \n    17 \n    2.110 \n  \n  \n    18 \n    2.101 \n  \n  \n    19 \n    2.093 \n  \n  \n    20 \n    2.086 \n  \n  \n    21 \n    2.080 \n  \n  \n    22 \n    2.074 \n  \n  \n    23 \n    2.069 \n  \n  \n    24 \n    2.064 \n  \n  \n    25 \n    2.060 \n  \n  \n    26 \n    2.056 \n  \n  \n    27 \n    2.052 \n  \n  \n    28 \n    2.048 \n  \n  \n    29 \n    2.045 \n  \n  \n    30 \n    2.042 \n  \n  \n    31 \n    2.040 \n  \n  \n    32 \n    2.037 \n  \n  \n    33 \n    2.035 \n  \n  \n    34 \n    2.032 \n  \n  \n    35 \n    2.030 \n  \n  \n    36 \n    2.028 \n  \n  \n    37 \n    2.026 \n  \n  \n    38 \n    2.024 \n  \n  \n    39 \n    2.023 \n  \n  \n    40 \n    2.021 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nOne test to compare two groups of scores is the \\(t\\)-test. One form of the \\(t\\)-test formula, assuming that the two groups have equal sample sizes, is as follows:\n\\[t = \\dfrac{M_1-M_2}{\\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\]\nThe numerator is simply the difference between the group means (the different group means are represented by the subscripts \\(1\\) and \\(2\\)). The denominator quantifies how much of a difference is to be expected due to chance alone. It divides each group variance (\\(s^2\\)) by the number of scores in that group, adds the answers, and then takes the square root.\nThe size of the \\(t\\) statistic required to conclude that a difference between groups is real depends on the size of the samples (how many observations you took). The greater the number of observations, the smaller the \\(t\\) required to identify a real difference. In order to determine the exact value of \\(t\\) required to declare the difference in groups to be reliable, several values must be determined.\nOne of these is the degrees of freedom for the test (\\(df\\)). The degrees of freedom, \\(df\\), is another statistical correction that weights the number of observations in each experimental group. Basically, we lose one degree of freedom for each group, so with two groups, \\(df = N – 2\\) (\\(N\\) being the total number of scores), or:\n\\[df=(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)\\]\nThe other quantity to determine is alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), or the significance level. By convention, this is usually set at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). This means that you are willing to chance being incorrect in your conclusion \\(.05\\) (or 5%) of the time. More specifically, if you were able to repeat your experiment a hundred times, even if your experimental manipulation does nothing at all sometimes you would observe group means that are quite far apart just by chance alone. Specifying \\(\\alpha = .05\\) means that you will only regard a difference between means as statistically significant if it is one so large that it would occur just 5% of the time if your manipulation didn’t actually work.\nOnce you know \\(df\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), you can proceed. Associated with each \\(df\\) value is a critical \\(t\\) value (see table to the right). This is a cutoff value; if the \\(t\\) statistic you calculate for your data exceeds this critical cutoff, you conclude that there is a statically significant difference between the groups, i.e. the groups differ more than would be expected by chance alone 95% of the time (with \\(\\alpha = .05\\), there is always a 5% chance of seeing such a difference by chance).\nMany tables of these cutoff values of \\(t\\) are available, for the many possible values of \\(df\\) and \\(\\alpha\\). Here, we provide a table that provides a table that assumes \\(\\alpha = .05\\). Look at the table and run down the \\(df\\) column until you find the value of \\(df\\) that matches the value for your data. The number to the right of that value is the critical value for \\(t\\) at the \\(\\alpha = .05\\) significance level.\n\nEffect size for two-group designs\nIn addition to knowing whether a difference between two groups is statistically significant, it is necessary to quantify the effect size. The most common measure of effect size for two-group designs is Cohen’s \\(d\\). This is standardized way of quantifying the magnitude of difference between groups caused by the experimental manipulation, in relation to the random variability in the data. Again assuming that the two groups have the same sample size, the formula for Cohen’s \\(d\\) is:\n\\[d = \\dfrac{M_1 - M_2}{(SD_1+ SD_2) / 2}\\]\nThe numerator gives the difference between group means. The denominator adds each group’s standard deviation and divides by two to give the average standard deviation of the two groups (also called pooled standard deviation). Therefore, if Cohen’s \\(d = 1.00\\), there was a difference between the groups of one standard deviation.\nCohen suggested the following rule of thumb for interpreting effect sizes in psychological research: \\(d = 0.2\\) indicates a small effect; \\(d = 0.5\\) indicates a moderate effect; \\(d = 0.8\\) indicates a large effect.\n\n\nStatistical power and sample size for two-group designs\nAn important aspect to consider when planning research is what sample size will be required—i.e, how many participants you should aim to recruit. This can be calculated in advance by using statistical principles and some assumptions about the quantities previously mentioned.\nFirst, consider alpha. As previously mentioned, for psychological research this is usually set as \\(\\alpha = .05\\). This is also known as the Type 1 error rate, or false positive rate—the frequency at which you would mistakenly think that your experimental manipulation had an effect when really it didn’t.\nSecond, the Type 2 error rate, or false negative rate, is how often you might fail to detect a real effect of your manipulation. This quantity is called beta (\\(\\beta\\)). It is related to alpha; a smaller alpha means a more stringent test, which means we are deliberately reducing our chances of detecting a real effect. But beta is also affected by sample size. The more participants in a study, the greater statistical power it will have, because increasing sample size makes it easier to detect real differences. For psychological research, it is common to specify a desired Type 2 error rate of 20%. The corresponding 80% is called the statistical power of the study: the chances that it will successfully detect the treatment effect it is designed to detect.\nThird, as previously explained, Cohen’s \\(d\\) measures effect size by dividing the size of difference between group means by the pooled standard deviation. You should be able to estimate the effect size you expect your manipulation to have based on previous research which has studied similar constructs. Failing that, you should specify the minimum effect size you would be willing to accept as meaningful.\nKnowing the values for alpha, power, and effect size allows you to calculate the required sample size. The following is an approximate equation for calculating the required sample size:\n\\(n = \\dfrac{2(Z_a + Z_B)^2}{d^2}\\)\nHere \\(d\\) is Cohen’s effect size. \\(Z_a\\) and \\(Z_B\\) are constants based on the mathematical properties of the normal distribution and our specified values for alpha (\\(.05\\)) and desired power (\\(.80\\)). For these values, \\(Z_a = 1.96\\); \\(Z_B = .8416\\). So if you expected your manipulation to cause a small effect (\\(d = 0.2\\)), you would require \\(2 * (1.96+0.8416)^2 / 0.22 \\approx 393\\) participants in each condition. For a large effect size like \\(0.8\\), you would require \\(2 * (1.96+0.8416)^2 / 0.80 \\approx 25\\) participants per condition.\n\n\n\nANOVA\nThe Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test is an extension of the \\(t\\) test. It is used where there are more than two groups to be compared. ANOVAs look at the ratio of variance between groups (deviations of group means from a grand mean) to error variance (deviation of individual scores). The larger the ratio, the more likely it is that the differences among groups are due to the experimental manipulation and not just due to chance.\nANOVA can even be used with more than one independent variable. Experiments often manipulate more than one independent variable, and examine the effects of those variables using ANOVA. This kind of analysis is called a “factorial” ANOVA, because there is more than one “factor”, meaning independent variable. The experimental design is referred to by the number of “levels” (meaning conditions) of each factor. For example, if a design has two independent variables, each with two different conditions, it would be referred to as a 2x2 ANOVA design. A 4x3x2 design has one factor with four levels, another factor with three levels, and a third factor with two levels.\nThese experiments can potentially describe the real world more completely and realistically. Consider the following example.\nSome research on people’s perceptions of procedural justice and fairness suggests that people feel they’ve been treated fairly when they get what they want. Some other research, however, suggests that people feel they’ve been treated fairly when they get what they deserve. So if you have behaved badly and you are then treated badly, you might be satisfied and say it was fair. A study to examine this hypothesis might manipulate people’s behavior as one independent variable; participants could put in a situation where they are led to behave either positively (not cheating on a test) or negatively (cheating on a test). The second independent variable might be how a research assistant then treats the participant, either respectfully or disrespectfully. This would be a 2x2 design—two IVs, each with two levels. The dependent variable—the thing that the researcher measures—might be participants’ feeling of how fairly they were treated.\nFactorial designs are more complicated to interpret, because of the more complicated design. One type of information we get is about the effect of each variable by itself. This is called the main effect. With two independent variables, there are two main effects. In the example above, either behavior or treatment could have had a significant effect on perceived fairness.\nThe second type of information we get from factorial designs is called an interaction. If there is an interaction, the effect of one independent variable depends on the level of the other independent variable. So in the above example, one outcome may be to find a main effect of treatment but no interaction; people might simply think they have been treated fairly when they were treated with respect, regardless of their actual behavior. However, another possible outcome would be to find an interaction between treatment and behavior; maybe your perception of the fairness of your treatment depends on how you behaved. If you are treated poorly but you did something to deserve it, you might perceive it as fair. One the other hand, being treated respectfully for bad behavior might be perceived as unfair. This would indicate an interaction.\n\nEffect size & power for ANOVA\nThe small, free application G*Power can help you determine required sample sizes for ANOVA designs. http://www.gpower.hhu.de/"

    "text": "Visualizing data\nEven though you won’t be collecting data, you will be forecasting plausible-seeming results. Doing so requires understanding at least the gist of the relevant statistics as described above. One other piece of the puzzle is thinking about your hypothetical data and results visually: how would it look as a graph? In fact, if you’re unsure about what results to expect, or you’re unsure whether your expected results are really plausible, thinking about a corresponding graph can help clarify your thinking.\nThere are a few standard ways of visualizing data, depending on the nature of the data and the design of the study. (Note that my examples here are deliberately rough; a pencil sketch is perfectly fine as long as it is clear.)\nFor bivariate correlational data, a scatterplot is usually appropriate. This will have a labelled x-axis and y-axis, one for each of your two variables. Which variable goes on which axis is somewhat arbitrary, though if you can think of your variables as a “predictor” (something you would know about a person) and “predicted” (the variable you want to predict based on the predictor), you can put the predictor on the x-axis and predicted on the y-axis (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure C.1: Example of a scatterplot showing a dot for each hypothetical data point. Note that axes should have meaningful labels.\n\n\nFor comparing groups—either two groups in a t-test design or three (or more) groups in a single-factor ANOVA design—a bar graph is often the best choice. Here the categorical grouping variable will be on the x-axis and scores on the dependent variables will be on the y-axis. Each bar represents a different group, and the height of the bar represents the average score on the DV of all participants within that group.\n\n\n\nFigure C.2: Example of a bar graph showing average scores on the dependent variable for three conditions of the independent variable. Errorbars represent the 95% Confidence Interval for each mean. Note that, again, your graph would have more meaningful labels.\n\n\nFor a 2x2 ANOVA design, a line graph can be clearest. In this case, one IV is represented as two marks on the x-axis, and the second IV is represented by separate lines (different colors, or solid and dashed, say). The y-axis represents scores on the DV.\n\n\n\nFigure C.3: Example of a 2x2 line graph. The two conditions of IV1 are represented on the x-axis, and the two conditions of IV2 are represented by the solid and dashed lines."

    "text": "Here’s an example debriefing from a study on national stereotypes—a potentially sensitive topic. Notes are in [italics].\n[First, thank participants and give them a general idea of what the study was about. Put things as plainly as possible; participants are likely unfamiliar with psychological jargon]\nYour participation is now complete. Thank you! This study was an investigation into the function of stereotypes. Many people have national stereotypes. For example, you can all probably imagine a stereotypical image of an English person or a German person or an American etc. Yet these stereotypes are not necessarily always the same in every situation. Sometimes people might vary their national stereotypes as a means of trying to justify their prior discriminatory behaviour. We want to see whether this might be true.\n[Next, give a full account of everything that participants were asked to do, and what purpose it served. Remember, if you use a between-participants design participants will be unaware of the conditions they were not exposed to, so make sure everyone understands both what they were asked to do and what other participants were asked to do. Take special care if any deception was involved or if you weren’t forthcoming about the true purpose of certain things. Participants should not be left with any misconceptions about your research]\nSo in this experiment we measured the national stereotypes of everyone and this acted as our main dependent variable. This was achieved by 2 methods. First, everyone completed the questions regarding how representative a list of traits was of a particular group (i.e. English and German). Second, the memory recall task was used to evaluate the extent to which people were activating stereotypes to help their recall. Better recall of stereotype-consistent words compared to stereotype-inconsistent words was taken as evidence of stereotype use. There were 3 simple manipulations in the overall design of the study. These were all included to encourage participants to engage in discriminatory behaviour. First, in all sessions we provided you with false information regarding a made-up study of the allocation strategies favoured by English students from different Universities. Second, in some sessions we gave you the opportunity to show discriminatory behaviour. Finally, in some sessions were asked you to offer an explanation of why English students might favour their own group.\n[After describing the method, describe your anticipated findings, and what such findings would demonstrate about human psychology]\nWe anticipate that participants who showed high levels of discrimination will produce different national stereotypes and activate national stereotypes more compared to participants who showed low levels of discrimination. If this is true, then our original suspicion regarding the justificatory function of stereotypes might be true.\n[Lastly, remind participants who to contact with any remaining questions, and thank them once more]\nPlease contact [researchers] at the following e-mail address […] if you have any questions regarding this study.\nTHANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION!"

    "section": "General tips for clear writing",
    "text": "General tips for clear writing\nThe goals of conciseness and clarity can only be achieved if you are a patient and careful editor of your writing. Give yourself time to read your work critically and make revisions before submitting. Is the meaning of each sentence clear? Have you omitted any important details necessary for understanding your point? Are there any repetitions that can be omitted without sacrificing clarity? Is the content of each section appropriate? An excellent way to spot awkward or wordy writing is to read the report aloud. Here are some specific issues to keep in mind:\n\nTone\nSentences in the report should be clear, concise and to the point. Usually a series of simple sentences is preferable to a single complicated sentence. Do not use exotic or complex words if plain words will do.\n\n\nAmbiguity\nAvoid ambiguity in your writing. Make sure that statements made in the same or different sections do not contradict each other. A common error is to refer to data without being specific: “the response rate was high (or low, or moderate, etc.)…” Such descriptions need a referent–high relative to what rate? “These findings were not clearcut…”—what makes findings clear-cut? Make sure the reader knows what you mean!\n\n\nRepetition of terms\nFor terms that appear frequently in your report, write out the term the first time it is used, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. You may then abbreviate later uses of the term. (But, no abbreviations should appear at the beginning of a sentence.) Do not, however, abbreviate too many terms in your report. Sentences such as: “The effect of SRI on HTMB may be mediated by SRC” are unintelligible.\n\n\nTense\nAt various points in your report you will be writing about existing, completed research; your interpretation of those existing findings; your future plans for your proposed study; and your interpretation of what your hypothetical findings would mean. Therefore, you will use a mix of present, past, and future/conditional tense.\nFor much of the Introduction, you will use past tense to describe existing research and its findings:\n\nBrotherton and Son (2020) studied the metacognitive processes underlying factual knowledge and opinion.\n\n\nIn previous studies, conspiracy beliefs have been shown to correlate with uncertainty (e.g. van Prooijen et al., 2013).\n\nHowever, your own interpretation of things should be put in present tense:\n\nThese findings suggest that claims perceived to be true are seen as matters of fact, while claims judged false tend to be seen as opinion.\n\nThe Method section, in which you describe the plan for how your study would be conducted, will be largely future tense:\n\nParticipants will complete the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale.\n\nLikewise, the Results section:\n\nWe expect participants in the Uncertainty prompt condition to score higher on conspiracist ideation than participants in the Certainty prompt condition.\n\nAn exception is that you should use the present tense when you make reference to graphs or tables (e.g., Figure 1 shows…). Here you are making a statement about the report that is present at the time of reading and not about the experiment or the analysis you intend to carry out (or already carried out in the past).\nThe Discussion, like the Introduction, will involve a mix of past-tense summarizing of prior research, conditional-tense speculation about your future hypothetical findings, and present-tense interpretation of what it all means.\n\nIf the findings are consistent with the hypothesis it will suggest…\n\n\nThis would fit with the existing findings showing a correlation between…\n\n\nOverall, this research would suggest that people’s beliefs about political conspiracies are open to influence.\n\nBasically, use your common sense and try to write in a way that gives an accurate impression of what has already happened and what is as-yet hypothetical.\n\n\nStyle\nWhen you write a psychological report, you are a scientist. Scientific writing is descriptive, and personal memoirs are inappropriate. Pronouns are almost always inappropriate unless you are telling personal story. The fact that you personally are involved in the enterprise is not directly relevant to the scientific merit of the discussion.\nThis tone may lead to the frequent use of passive sentences. But this use is stylistically objectionable when too many such sentences are strung together. Often a little thought will permit you to avoid both first person (I, we) and the passive voice. Consider:\nPoor:\n\nParticipants will be administered twenty trials in a session.\n\nBetter:\n\nA session will consist of twenty trials.\n\nFound, observed, showed are almost always inappropriate. “Uncertainty impaired discrimination” is preferable to “uncertainty was found to impair discrimination.” Obviously, if you know this result, somebody found it. Unless you want to emphasize history about the process of findings, the result is important, not the process."

    "section": "Sections of a Lab Report",
    "text": "Sections of a Lab Report\n\nTitle Page\nThe title page is the first page of the lab report. It contains the title, author, institution, and running head.\nTitle. The title is centered between the left and right margins in the top half of the title page. A good title includes no more than 12 words. The first letters of all major words of the title are capitalized. In general, titles are detailed enough to distinguish one article from another. The title should reveal the central point of your experiment (the topic being studied, the key variables you are looking at, or the hypothesized outcome). The research you read for your literature review will provide appropriate examples.\nYour name (as author) should appear centered and double-spaced directly below the title. Double-spaced and centered underneath your name appears the institution with which you are affiliated—in this case, Barnard College. Running Head. The running head can be up to 50 characters long, including spaces and punctuation. It is entirely capitalized and typed flush left at the top of the title page, preceded by the words “Running head,” followed by a colon. On subsequent pages, the words “Running head” are omitted. Page Numbers. Each and every page (including the title page) of your manuscript 1111 should have the page number in the upper right corner, in addition to the left-aligned running head. Use the header function in your word processing program to have this appear at the top of each page in your paper. Number every page of text, including the title page and any tables that your report might include. Figures appear on pages that are not numbered.\n\n\nAbstract\nThe second page of the paper is the Abstract. Use the page or section break feature of your Word processor; do not just keep hitting Enter/Return until you get to the next page. This will minimize things moving around as you edit your paper.\nThe Abstract is a single-paragraph capsule version of the paper. The abstract is short (100-200 words), but it should reflect material from each part of the report. The general topic and gist of previous research should be mentioned, the main aspects of your method must be presented, and your important anticipated results must be stated, together with an interpretive statement that summarizes your discussion. Usually you will write the Abstract last.\nWhen typing the abstract page, the word “Abstract” is centered and bolded at the top of the page, with the text beginning two spaces below. Unlike other sections of the lab report, the first word of the abstract is not indented. The abstract appears on its own page, immediately after the title page.\nKeywords appear after the abstract paragraph on a new line, indented and preceded by “Keywords:” in italics. The keywords themselves are not italicized, should be lowercase, and separated by commas. They don’t have to be in alphabetical order. Keywords address essential paper elements, such as the research topic, population, method, and/or application of results.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Introduction begins on a new page following the Abstract (p. 3). Again, use the page break feature of your Word processor; do not just keep hitting Enter/Return until you get to the next page. The title of the report is centered at the top of the page (this section is not labeled “Introduction”), and text begins below with the first line indented. The Introduction should contain background information about your project. It defines concepts described in the study and gives the reader the theoretical bases for any predictions or hypotheses you propose.\nBegin by making a general statement about the broad field of inquiry. Is there a relevant real-world example that can introduce your topic? What makes this an important topic of investigation? You should be citing other sources of information to explain the logical basis for your research question. More often than not, your research is an outgrowth of prior studies, whose findings you are attempting to extend, validate, disprove or replicate. Therefore, you should mention the specific contributions of related studies. In your introduction, build a logical argument that will lead your reader to the hypothesis of your experiment. Your introduction should provide the reader with an understanding of the reason this experiment was performed.\nIn the closing paragraph of the introduction you should state the specific goal of your study. At this point, your reader should clearly understand the variables you are examining and why. Provide a statement of your hypothesis. Clearly indicate what results were expected and what they will mean. This is a critical part of the report. which links the Introduction to the Method and Results sections.\n\nCitations\nReferences are cited in the Introduction and throughout the paper. In research reports, it is unusual to quote the writing of other scientists directly. Most often, the methodology, results, and conclusions of other research reports are described in your own words and then the research report is credited by citing the authors using this format:\n\nAccording to a 2015 poll, 71% of Americans believe in miracles, 42% believe in ghosts, 41% believe in extrasensory perception, and 29% believe in astrology (Van der Linden, 2015).\n\nIf you are describing the history of a particular line of research, question, or controversy, it may also be appropriate to use the following format, which places greater emphasis on the author.\n\nHofstadter (1964) argued that conspiracy theories are a constant feature of American politics.\n\nWhen an article with two authors is cited in parentheses in the text the names are separated by an ampersand (Jolley & Douglas, 2017). When the citation is directly in the text and not parenthesized, the authors’ names are separated by “and”:\n\nIn a study of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, Jolley and Douglas (2017)…\n\nWhen there are more than two authors, only the first author is mentioned, followed by “et al.” (indicating “and all”).\nWhen several different experiments are referred to as a group, it is customary to include an alphabetical list of the authors’ names, as well as the dates of publication within the parentheses, separated by semi-colons. It can also be appropriate to include more than one parenthetical citation in a sentence, so that it is clear which cited study produced each finding:\n\nConspiracy theories can lead to social and political disengagement (Butler et al., 1995; Jolley & Douglas, 2013) and may help to foster political extremism (Bartlett & Miller, 2010)…\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nStart the Method section with a Level 1 heading immediately following the end of the Introduction; do not take a new page. The Method section describes the proposed conduct of the study. It should provide the reader enough information to reproduce your research. The Method section generally has the following four subsections, each with a Level 2 heading (though in the published papers you read the format may vary depending on the research and authors’ preference):\n\nDesign\nHere you give a brief, technical statement of the design of your study. This states the psychological constructs of interest, whether they are independent or dependent variables in your study, and whether any independent variables are manipulated between- or within-participants. For example:\n\nA 2x2 between-participants ANOVA design will be used. The first independent variable will be participants’ behavior (cheat vs. no-cheat); the second independent variable will be participants’ treatment (respectful vs. disrespectful). The dependent variable will be participants’ perceived fairness of their treatment.\n\nYou don’t need to explain how you operationalize the constructs here—you will do that in detail in the materials and/or procedure subsections.\n\n\nParticipants\nHere you will explain how many participants you require for your study (based on the concept of statistical power explained in Appendix C). You should also state any special inclusion/exclusion criteria, e.g. if your study requires only adults, children, college students, if you’re seeking participants with certain characteristics, comparing nationalities, etc.\n\n\nMaterials\nHere you will explain how you will operationalize all your constructs of interest. For each scale or task you will have participants complete, give all the information that would be required for another researcher to do the same study. For questionnaire scales, give the full wording of questions and response scales. For longer scales with many questions, give two or three example items and put the complete scale in an Appendix. You should also explain any videos, images, or other materials that your participants will encounter (include images as Figures in the text, or in Appendices). If you plan to administer several different measures, you can use Level 3 subheadings for each. You should also briefly explain why your chosen operationalization is appropriate; e.g. has it been used in previous research and shown to be valid and reliable? Or, if it is a scale you have designed yourself, what advantages does it have over existing scales and how can you be sure it measures what you intend it to measure?\n\n\nProcedure\nLastly, the procedure subsection provides a step-by-step description of what participants will be required to do as they take part in your research. Mention the order of tasks, any key instructions that will be delivered either in writing or verbally by the experimenters, and any other information along these lines that you haven’t already fully explained in the Materials subsection. Remember that, as a whole, the Method section must give the reader all the necessary information to run your proposed study themselves, so you shouldn’t leave anything up to guesswork. It may be useful to have a friend who isn’t familiar with your work read this section and tell you anything that remains unclear.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe Results section appears immediately below the Method section with no page break between sections. In published papers, the Results section describes statistical analyses that have already been carried out on the data. Your Results section will describe the intended analytical treatment of the data verbally, including anticipated numbers and illustrative figures. If you plan to perform several analyses looking at different questions, it may be helpful to use subheadings in the Results section to clarify presentation of your findings.\nIf you plan to manipulate the data in some way, for example by calculating an average of several different questions, begin by explaining that process. A verbal description of the expected pattern of findings (e.g. Group A is expected to score higher, on average, than Group B) should always be presented first. Then you will describe your planned inferential test (i.e. performing a t-test, ANOVA, or correlation). As you describe each anticipated finding in the text, it may be helpful to refer the reader to a figure that shows the expected trends in graphical form. Always tell the reader what to look for in tables and figures and provide sufficient explanation to make them readily intelligible. Figures and Tables are numbered consecutively and are placed after the References section at the end of your research report. Refer to figures and tables by number in the text of your report.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe Discussion section should begin by reintroducing the general topic and hypothesis to your reader, followed by the conclusions that may be drawn from the results. Your statements should interpret the expected results and relate them to the questions raised in the Introduction. Be sure to focus the discussion on the major effect(s) found in the experiment. However, all results mentioned in the Results section should be discussed here. Be sure to describe your results as they relate to the hypothesis you developed in the Introduction section. You must also relate your findings to the wider literature which you reviewed in the Introduction—how do your findings fit with what has been found before, and what implications do your results hold for the theoretical background reviewed in the Introduction? Suggestions for further research (or for improving the present research) may be mentioned but should not be the major focus of the discussion.\nAfter considering what it would mean if your results work out the way you expect, you should consider the other possibility—what would it mean if the data did not support your hypothesis? You may want to describe characteristics of the data or procedure that may account for the unusual findings. A discussion of unexpected results should be an occasion to propose further research to clarify the causes of surprise. If your data did not support your hypotheses, it is your job to fully consider reasons why that was the case. Perhaps your study was flawed in some way and thus failed to find the expected trends, or perhaps your study was fine and the trends you expected just don’t exist. When considering limitations, it is important to justify why something may be a limitation. You may even argue that an apparent limitation probably didn’t affect your results. So for example, if you are studying political beliefs and your data had more Democrats than Republicans that might be a limitation, but you need to make a reasoned case why that characteristic would (or wouldn’t) have affected your findings. The most common flaw of Discussion sections is failing the consider your own findings in relation to the existing literature reviewed in the Introduction. You should mention most of the ideas and findings mentioned in your Introduction again in the Discussion, but you shouldn’t merely repeat the same thing as before. Rather you will reevaluate those ideas in the new context of your own potential findings.\n\n\nReferences\nThe Reference section begins on a new page, with the title “References” as a Level 1 heading. Only include books or articles that you have cited in the text of your paper; the References section should not contain anything not mentioned in the text. Conversely, everything you do cite in the text should have a corresponding entry in the References section.\nEach journal article reference should include author’s name, year of publication, title of article, journal name (italicized), volume number (italicized), pages on which the article appears, and the article’s DOI (digital object identifier). Book entries contain author, title (italicized), publisher name, and year of publication. References are alphabetized by authors’ last names and initials. Book and journal titles are italicized, but article titles are not. Only the first letter of the first word of book and article titles is capitalized. Journal titles should not be abbreviated. The first line of each entry begins at the left margin, and subsequent lines are indented (use the “hanging indent” feature of your word processor). Page numbers should be included for journal articles and for a chapter in an edited book.\n\nExamples\n\nAn article in a journal:\n\n\n Brotherton, R., French, C. C., & Pickering, A. D. (2013).
