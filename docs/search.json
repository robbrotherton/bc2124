    "text": "Course overview\nThis lab is designed to offer experience participating in, reading, critiquing, and proposing research addressing social psychological phenomena. The lab will usually be taken concurrently with PSYC-BC2138 Social Psychology Lecture, and will expand upon the methodological and analytic issues introduced there, as well as giving you the opportunity to explore in greater depth a topic of your choosing from within (or beyond) those covered in the lectures by proposing your own original research project.\n\nResearch projects\nThe semester is broken into 3 projects. Each section will culminate in an in-class presentation and submission of a brief write up of your project.\n\n\nClass format & participation\nLabs are substantially more interactive and discussion-based than the traditional lecture format, and depend on everyone’s participation. Your active participation across the semester will therefore contribute a substantial portion of your grade.\nIf you have questions, thoughts, or ideas you want to share, feel free to do so at any time (while keeping within the bounds of polite conversation, obviously–don’t interrupt or talk over other people! But do feel free to respond to others without having to raise your hand or wait to be called on). Everyone will get the most out of this lab when the discussion can develop organically and everyone feels free to be part of the conversation if & when they have something to add.\nBeing part of the in-person discussion is one obvious way to participate, but it’s not the only way. Different people have different styles of participation, and the lab is designed to try and accommodate and encourage different approaches (as well as allowing for the greater-than-usual possibility of missing class for health reasons). Your level of engagement with your project partner(s), your TA and Prof. Brotherton as you work through your project is also an important form of participation. You can also participate by coming to office hours.\nAt a minimum, I’ll be looking for some form of participation (loosely defined) from you every week; higher participation grades will be earned through regular, enthusiastic, productive participation (note that quality is more important than quantity).\n\n\nWorkload\nAs a general rule for the amount of time students should expect to commit to classes, the college suggests three hours per week in or outside of class per credit. Since this class is worth 1.5 credits, that corresponds to 4.5 hours per week, split between time in the classroom and time spent completing the associated assignments.\n\n\nFinal Grades\nYour final letter grade for the course is a product of your scores for each assignment, weighted as indicated in the class schedule, and determined according to the following boundaries:\nLetter grade:  A+ A  A- B+ B  B- C+ C  C- D  F\nNumeric score: 97 93 90 87 83 80 77 73 70 60 &lt;60"

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAttendance & timeliness\nIn-person attendance of each lab session is expected, except in emergencies. Normally it is departmental policy to remove students who miss more than two sessions from the course; however, given ongoing revisions to college-wide health-related policies, exceptions may be made. If you are feeling unwell, you should not come to class and notify me of nonattendance before class if possible. When you are attending, please arrive on time for class. Frequent lateness will impact your participation grade.\n\n\nAssignment deadlines & late policy\nAssignments are listed in the class schedule next to the class session to which they correspond. Most assignments are due at 5pm the day after class. All assignments relate to your project proposal—the idea is to build this major piece of work incrementally over the course of the semester. The 5pm next-day deadline is necessary to allow time to provide substantive feedback to everyone in advance of the next assignment.\nA grade penalty of 5 points will be applied for each day (or part thereof) that an assignment is late (up to a maximum of 6 days; work not submitted before the next lab will receive a score of zero). For example, if your work is A+ quality but is submitted a day-and-a-half late, you will only receive a B+. Due to time constraints, you may also not receive feedback on late work.\nThis policy is intended to incentivize timely submission while easing the stress of genuine emergencies. When things come up that prevent timely submission you can prioritize accordingly, knowing that a small penalty on one assignment for this lab will not tank your final grade.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nStudents are expected to follow the Barnard Honor Code, available at https://barnard.edu/honor-code.\nNote that even though you may collaborate in lab and on the research proposal, you may not collaborate on written assignments. You must write your own reports.\n\n\nAcademic accommodations and general wellness\nIt is always important to recognize the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. The faculty and administration recognize this, and are prepared to provide assistance to students in need. I encourage you to seek advice from your advisor, Dean, the Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS), or Barnard Health & Wellness as needed. Please let me know of any issues you wish to share with me that you feel are impacting your ability to complete the course to the best of your ability. Though it isn’t always easy, it is better to proactively seek help rather than letting problems build up."

    "text": "Project planning\nA correlation refers an association between two things. It is a statement of a statistical relationship–a general tendency, rather than a rigid law. To say that some aspect of personality is correlated with something else–for example, neuroticism is correlated with lower wellbeing or openness is correlated with greater cognitive ability–is to say that those things tend to go together. Not everyone who scores high on neuroticism will have lower wellbeing than anyone low on neuroticism, but there is some tendency for the two to go together on the whole.\nOf course, these kind of correlations aren’t just facts found lying around in nature; they are empirical findings produced by researchers. All the findings you learn about in the personality psychology lecture (and beyond) are the product of research procedures. Researchers decide what psychological constructs they want to investigate; how to operationally define those constructs; what statistical analyses are appropriate; and what conclusions may be drawn.\nWith this project, you will examine a correlation between a personality trait and some other construct of your choosing by analyzing existing data.\nAt the start of next week’s class, each project team will give a short, informal presentation of their research proposal.

Specifically, for this project we will use data collected around the 2016 election. The reason for using this (instead of more recent data) is that the 2016 survey included a personality scale: the Ten-item Personality Inventory (TIPI: Gosling et al., 2003). This allow us to look at how the Big 5 personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism correlate with any of the other variables recorded in the survey."

    "text": "Step 2. Find relevant research\nReal research doesn’t happen in a vacuum; research plans and expectations should be informed by what has come before. Therefore once you have an idea of what variables you would like to analyze, you will search the literature to see what other researchers have found of these (or related) personality traits.\n\nWhatto look for\nA published, scholarly journal article detailing an empirical finding relevant to your variables of interest. This might be a paper reporting one or several individual studies that the researchers conducted, or it may be a review or meta-analysis1 paper.\n\n\nWhere to look\n\nGoogle Scholar\nGoogle Scholar searches the full text of scholarly articles. It casts a wide net, searching across all disciplines, and including books and other materials in addition to journal articles, so will likely find many articles not very relevant to the topic as well as those that are relevant.\n\n\nAPA PsycINFO\nThe link above should take you to PsycINFO, a database for scholarly psychology research (you can also serch for psycinfo in a CLIO quicksearch). PsycInfo gives you the ability to do much more focused searching than Google Scholar.\n\nYou can do sequential searches and then combine them with the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT by selecting them from the dropdown boxes.\nYou can select where your keywords should appear, i.e. in the title, abstract, or full text of articles. Selecting Word in Major Subject Heading can help narrow down your search to articles that are actually on the topic you’re interested in (rather than just containing the keyword).\nThe APA Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms link at the top can be useful for finding technical terms used in psychology, and other related ideas."

    "text": "Getting R ready\nIn addition to containing a Big 5 personality scale, the ANES 2016 dataset is convenient for our purposes because someone went to the trouble of creating an R package which makes working with the ANES data relatively straightforward (not that you won’t still run into issues!): anesr (github.com/jamesmartherus/anesr).\nTo start exploring the data in R, you first need to set up your environment. This means installing the anesr package from github. Since the package is hosted on GitHub (as opposed to the official R repository of packages), the easiest way to install it is by first installing the devtools package, which has a function for installing other packages from GitHub.\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"jamesmartherus/anesr\")\n\nWe will also use some other packages for data wrangling and analysis. Developers have created a collection of packages for R called the tidyverse to make coding these common tasks easier. The tidyverse can be installed like so:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nIf you execute those lines of code the packages will be installed on your system. That step only needs to be done once, but you need to ‘activate’ the packages using library() to make their functions and data available each time to start a new R session.\n\nlibrary(anesr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)"

You’ll only need a few of those. So the first step is selecting just the variables you need to work with.\nThere are a lot of ways to do this. The simplest would be to make a note of the variable IDs from the codebook and use them within dplyr’s select() function. This allows us to simply type in variable names separated by commas. You can also give the columns new names when selecting,\nFor this example I’ll look at the correlation between extraversion and the ‘feeling thermometer’ for the Democratic Party. Extraversion has two TIPI items; their IDs (from the codebook) are V162333 and V162338. The ID for the Democratic Party feeling thermometer is V161095.\n\nmy_data &lt;- timeseries_2016 |&gt; \n  select(extraversion1 = \"V162333\", \n         extraversion2 = \"V162338\", ,\n         feeling_thermometer = \"V161095\")\n\nLet’s see what this new data.frame looks like:\n\nmy_data\n\n# A tibble: 4,270 × 3\n   extraversion1 extraversion2 feeling_thermometer\n   &lt;hvn_lbll&gt;    &lt;hvn_lbll&gt;    &lt;hvn_lbll&gt;         \n 1 6             5              0                 \n 2 6             6             15                 \n 3 6             2             50                 \n 4 6             4             30                 \n 5 5             7             70                 \n 6 5             6             15                 \n 7 5             1             85                 \n 8 6             3              0                 \n 9 7             1             15                 \n10 5             5             50                 \n# ℹ 4,260 more rows\n\n\nIt all looks good so far. But if you inspect the data more extensively (click the name in your Environment and scroll down a bit) you’ll notice that there are some negative numbers in the data. That’s from survey codes which record missing data. If you try to calculate an average score with those included it’ll mess up the sums, so we need to do some data cleaning to handle things like that.\n\n\nCleaning the data\nThere are a lot of different ways we could handle this. One way is to filter() the data, retaining only rows which meet certain conditions.\n\nmy_data_complete &lt;- my_data |&gt;\n  filter(if_all(contains(\"extraversion\"), ~ . %in% 1:7))  |&gt; \n  filter(feeling_thermometer &gt;= 0)\n\nNotice how many rows have been removed:\n\nnrow(my_data)\n\n[1] 4270\n\nnrow(my_data_complete)\n\n[1] 3540\n\n\nAnother way would be to mutate() the data; that is, change certain values based on some condition.\n\n# my_data_complete &lt;- my_data |&gt;\n#     mutate(across(contains(\"extraversion\"), ~case_when(\n#         . &lt; 1 ~ NA,\n#         TRUE ~ .\n#     ))) |&gt; \n#     mutate(feeling_thermometer = case_when(feeling_thermometer &lt; 0 ~ NA, TRUE ~ feeling_thermometer))\n\n\n\nComputing scale averages\nNow that the data is subsetted and the missing/invalid responses are taken care of, the last thing to do is compute any new values required for analysis. As an example, if you have a scale which has multiple questions asking about a particular construct, it is often necessary to compute an average score for each participant.\nThe TIPI has 10 questions in total, two for each of the Big 5 personality traits. So it may be desirable to compute a mean trait score by averaging its two respective items.\nNotice, however, that for each of the 5 traits, one question is positively worded and one is negatively worded. For extraversion, item V162333 is “extraverted, enthusiastic”, while item V162338 is “reserved, quiet”. The second one needs to be reverse-coded, so that higher scores on both items indicate greater extraversion. Since answers can range from 1 to 7, an easy way to recode the scores is to subtract the participant’s response from 8; 1 becomes 7, 2 becomes 6, etc.\n\nmy_data_complete &lt;- my_data_complete |&gt;\n    mutate(extraversion2 = 8 - extraversion2)\n\nNow we can go ahead and compute the average, using mutate() to create a new column containing the rowMeans() (i.e. an average for each row) for the specified columns.\n\nmy_data_complete &lt;- my_data_complete |&gt;\n    mutate(extraversion_mean = rowMeans(across(contains(\"extraversion\"))))"

    "text": "Visualizing the data\nAs with most things, there are a lot of different ways of producing graphs using R. One of the most widely used and powerful is the ggplot2 package.1 The name refers to the idea of the “grammar of graphics”, and it is built around a layering approach. You first specify your data and aesthetics (what should data will go on the x and y axes), then geometry (do you want data to be represented by points or bars or as a histogram?), any scaling (e.g. what values should be labeled on each axis), and theme elements (how do you want the plot to look generally?). There can be a lot of complexity, but building things up layer by layer, gradually adding and refining elements, is a powerful and satisfying approach.\n\nmy_data_complete |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = extraversion1)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n\nDon't know how to automatically pick scale for object of type &lt;haven_labelled&gt;.\nDefaulting to continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Histogram of responses to “extraverted, enthusiastic” TIPI item\n\n\n\n\nThe default theme is perfectly serviceable, but you can customize every element. Here I’ll specify a couple of aspects using the theme() function, and I’ll assign it to the name theme_apa. Then I can always add theme_apa as a layer to my plots going forward.\n\ntheme_apa &lt;- theme(\n  panel.background = element_blank(),\n  axis.line = element_line()\n)\n\n\nmy_data_complete |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = extraversion1)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7) +\n  theme_apa\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Histogram of responses to “extraverted, enthusiastic” TIPI item\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_data_complete |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = 8 - extraversion2)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7) +\n  theme_apa\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Histogram of responses to “reserved, quiet” TIPI item\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_data_complete |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = extraversion_mean)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7) +\n  theme_apa\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Histogram of average scores on TIPI Extraversion subscale\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_data_complete |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = feeling_thermometer)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 10)) +\n  theme_apa\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Histogram of responses to Democratic Party feeling thermometer"

    "text": "Guide to presenting\nEach team will give a two-minute presentation, accompanied by a single PowerPoint slide, which should encapsulate the motivation, methods, anticipated findings, and interpretation of your proposed project. Two minutes is not a lot of time. Apparently, people speak at a rate of around 125 to 150 words per minute on average. So a 2-minute presentation will be no more than around 300 words. The single-slide, not-many-words format demands clarity, conciseness, and being bold to spark the audience’s interest in your topic.\nAvoid simply reading excerpts from your paper. That would be boring, and would probably take up too many words. Make it fun and interesting. Try to grab the audience’s attention and hit them with just the most important points of your ideas.\nYou will also have a single PowerPoint slide to accompany your presentation. Make it count. You can’t just cram a load of text on there, because nobody will be able to read it. Plus, it’d distract from what you’re saying. Make it a visual aid that somehow supports or clarifies what you’re saying. It might be a visual representation of your design, a key piece of your experimental stimuli, a graph of your expected results, or just a pertinent meme which conveys the motivation for your question.\nAfter your two-minute talk you’ll take a few questions from the audience, and your responsiveness will contribute toward your grade as well as the quality of your presentation itself (remember a perfectly acceptable answer if often: “Good question; I don’t know the answer!”). It’s not usually an issue, but just in case your audience is left speechless, I suggest coming with a couple of questions or thoughts of your own that you can throw at the audience to spark more questions.\nEach pair will be allotted five minutes total for their talk and Q&A. Going over time and/or failing to leave time for questions will impact your presentation grade. It is up to each pair to decide how to divide up the two-minute talk, and to practice to make sure the presentation is to time."

For example, you might compute an average in Sheets by typing =AVERAGE(A1:A10). In R you might type mean(my_data$column_a). The specifics of the function names are different, but the basic idea is the same.\nThere are two other ideas that will help you get started coding in R."
