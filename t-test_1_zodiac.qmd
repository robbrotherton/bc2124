# Project Planning

In this session we will begin the first project of the course: investigating personality differences between people with different astrological starsigns. By the end of the session you will have a plan for your project


### Goals

-   Identify the variables for your analysis
-   Read some relevant research
-   Articulate your hypothesis


## Project overview

A *correlation* refers an association between two things. It is a statement of a statistical relationship--a general tendency, rather than a rigid law. To say that some aspect of personality is correlated with something else--for example, [neuroticism is correlated with lower wellbeing](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-03328-001.html) or [openness is correlated with greater cognitive ability](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212794120)--is to say that those things *tend* to go together. Not everyone who scores high on neuroticism will have lower wellbeing than anyone low on neuroticism, but there is some tendency for the two to go together on the whole.

Of course, these kind of correlations aren't just facts found lying around in nature; they are empirical findings produced by researchers. All the findings you learn about in the personality psychology lecture (and beyond) are the product of research procedures. Researchers decide what psychological constructs they want to investigate; how to measure those constructs; what statistical analyses are appropriate; and what conclusions may be drawn. There are strengths, limitations, and trade offs involved in every decision along the way.

With this project, you will examine a correlation between a personality trait and another construct of your choosing by analyzing existing data.


### Step 1. Examine the data

The dataset we will use is from the [American National Election Studies (ANES)](https://electionstudies.org/), academic surveys of voters in the United States conducted before and after every presidential election, going back to the 1940s. Specifically, for this project we will use data collected around the 2016 election. The reason for using this (rather than more recent data) is that the 2016 survey included a personality scale: the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI: [Gosling et al., 2003](https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/JRP-03-tipi.pdf)). This scale is a short measure of the "Big Five" personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 

For this project, you will pick one of these traits and investigate its correlation with another question from the survey. The full dataset contains almost 2,000 questions in total. Since this is your first project, however, I am going to constrain your choice. For this kind of correlation analysis you will have two variables. You can think of one as the "predictor" and the other as the "outcome"; you want to see if the predictor has any association with the outcome.

Your __dependent__ variable will be one of the Big Five traits:

- Extraversion (`big5a1` & `big5a2`)
- Agreeableness (`big5b1` & `big5b2`)
- Conscientiousness (`big5c1` & `big5c2`)
- Neuroticism (`big5d1` & `big5d2`)
- Openness (`big5e1` & `big5e2`)


Your __quasi-independent__ variable will be Zodiac star-sign. Specifically, you will select two groups to compare (e.g. Leo versus Virgo).


To see exactly how these constructs were measured you will look up the variable IDs (the `big5xx` codes in parentheses above) in the [Codebook](https://gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/gss_codebook.pdf).


### Step 2. Read relevant research

Real research doesn't happen in a vacuum; research plans and expectations should be informed by what has come before. Therefore once you know which variables you will analyze, you will see what other researchers have found about these (or related) personality traits.

A real research project would involve an exhaustive literature review, in which you attempt to find and understand all the research relevant to your question. Since this project of ours is just for practice and our time is limited, you don't need to read everything; pick one of these papers to skim to give you an idea of what has been found.

### Step 3. Articulate your hypothesis

By this point you should be able to state your:

- __Operational definitions__ (that is, the specific questions that participants were asked and how they could answer, per the codebook)
- The __constructs__ that those operational definitions measure (i.e. does the question measure perceived political preferences *in general*? Or some more specific form of affiliation/alignment?)
- Your __hypothesis__

Your hypothesis is a formal statement of your expectation about how your constructs are (or aren't) associated, and it will be tested quantitatively by calculating a correlation statistic.

The main question that your hypothesis addresses is: do you think the two variables will be significantly correlated? That is, will you find an association consistent enough that it doesn't just seem to be attributable to chance variation in the data?^[Even random data will produce spurious correlations by chance some of the time; see [spuriouscorrelations.com](https://spuriouscorrelations.com#stat897f4cbec4629379cd566c68c3f40c5f)]

If you do expect a significant correlation, you should also specify whether you expect it to be positive or negative, and how strong you expect it to be (i.e. weak, moderate, strong; see [Appendix B](appendix-correlation.html#sec-cor-effect-size)).


<!-- ## To do for next time -->

<!-- Read up on the development of the TIPI ([Gosling et al., 2003](https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/JRP-03-tipi.pdf)). -->

<!-- The more detailed your understanding of how the Big Five trait was measured, the better you will be able to interpret the results of your analysis. -->
