# Lab 10: Scale planning {.unnumbered}

My hope is that at this point you are feeling a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved through the secondary data analysis projects so far, but that you're also feeling a bit limited by choice of variables you had and the inability to decide what exactly to measure or how to measure it. In this lab we'll begin the final project: devising and piloting a novel measure of a personality trait of your choice.


## Goals

- Understand the process of scale design and validation
- Pick a personality trait to design a scale around
- Write a brief proposal of your project and expectations


## Scale design

Scale design is a fundamental aspect of empirical psychology. Psychological constructs such as personality traits, intelligence, attitudes, or mental health conditions are abstract and not directly observable. Psychologists use scales, or tests, to measure these constructs, translating abstract ideas into quantifiable variables. For instance, the Big Five personality traits are typically measured using self-report scales like the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) or the NEO-PI-R.

Creating a good psychological scale involves several steps. First, researchers need to clearly define the construct they want to measure. Then, they develop a set of items, or questions, that reflect the construct. These items should be clear, easy to understand, and specific to the construct. After developing the items, researchers typically pilot the scale on a small sample to check that the items measure what they're supposed to. The scale is then refined based on this pilot data. Once the scale is finalized, it can be used in research.

Importantly, creating a scale is not a one-time process. Scales need to be validated â€“ tested to make sure they're measuring what they're supposed to. This involves collecting data and conducting statistical analyses to check the reliability (consistency of the scale) and validity (whether the scale measures the construct it is supposed to) of the scale.

In this project, you will take on the role of a scale developer, designing a new scale to measure a construct of your choosing. You'll begin by defining your construct, generating a set of items, and establishing a response format. You'll then create a plan to pilot and validate your scale. This project will provide you with firsthand experience of the challenges and rewards of psychological measurement and get you thinking about underexplored aspects of personality.


### Step 1. Decide what aspect of personality you want to measure

Brainstorm ideas with your group. Something relevant to your personality experience.

To give you some ideas, here are a few existing personality scales. 



### Step 2. Find relevant research

Once you have an idea for what personality construct you want to measure. 


### Step 3. Come up with a plan
