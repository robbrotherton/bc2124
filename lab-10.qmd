# Lab 10: Project planning {.unnumbered}

My hope is that at this point you are feeling a sense of accomplishment at what you have achieved through the projects so far, but that you're also feeling a bit limited by the constrained choice of variables you had. In this lab we'll begin the final project: you will execute a project of your own design, with the freedom to choose any variables you like from the full data set.


### Goals

- Decide on an analysis and identify the relevant variables
- Find some relevant research
- Articulate your hypotheses



## Project overview

For this project you will use multiple regression to look at the relationships among an outcome variable and two or more predictors. You have free choice of outcome and predictors. The process for getting started planning your design is the same as before.


### Step 1. Decide on your constructs/operational definitions

The full ANES dataset contains more than 1,000 columns, each representing a different variable that was measured. Not all of these are equally relevant to personality, but you will find many questions that pertain to fundamental psychological concepts. The aim is to come up with a research question and design that allows you to meaningfully examine some aspect of personality psychology. 

Here are some suggestions for constructs you might consider analyzing, for which there are relevant questions in the 2016 ANES dataset:

- Big 5 personality traits (no reason you can't stick with one or more of these as part of your analysis)
- Feeling thermometers (affect towards various political actors/groups)
- Ideology/partisanship
- Media consumption
- Self-efficacy
- Perceived threats
- Trust
- Political knowledge
- Authoritarianism
- Stereotypes
- Policy preferences
- Conspiracy beliefs
- Religiosity
- Life experiences


### Step 2. Find relevant research

You should search the literature (using Google Scholar or PsycINFO, as before) and find at least one published research paper that pertains to the constructs you want to look at.


### Step 3. Articulate your hypotheses

As before, you should be able to describe:

- The constructs you are interested in
- The operational definitions used to measure those constructs in the ANES survey
- You hypothesis about how your constructs are related
