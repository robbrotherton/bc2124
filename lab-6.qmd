# Lab 6: Project planning {.unnumbered}

In this lab, you will start your second project: conducting a multiple regression analysis using the same 2016 ANES data.

### Goals

- Understand the purpose of multiple regression
- Identify variables for your analysis
- Search the literature to find relevant research
- Formulate a brief research proposal


## Project overview

With this project, you will dive deeper into the interplay between personality traits and other constructs, using multiple regression analysis to explore how several predictors are associated with an outcome of your choice. Multiple regression allows us to see the *cumulative* impact of multiple variables on an outcome variable, potentially revealing more complexity than the one-to-one correlations of Project 1.

For instance, researchers might examine how [age along with one or more Big Five personality traits predict job satisfaction](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306307016687990). Similarly, variables such as [income, education, and openness might be used in a multiple regression analysis to predict political ideology](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051010-111659). Like with correlations, this doesn't mean that every extroverted, conscientious, and emotionally stable person will be highly satisfied with their job, or that all educated, open individuals are politically aligned in the same way. It's about general tendencies rather than strict rules. 

Like correlation, regression studies involve determining which psychological constructs to study, how to operationally define those constructs, and how to measure them. As you saw in Project 1, the operational definitions have already been determined--the survey designers already asked the questions. But it will be up to you to make sense of what psychological constructs those operational definitions really represent and to consider the strengths, limitations, and implications for your analysis and interpretation.



### Step 1. Choose your variables

We will again use data from the 2016 ANES survey. For your regression, you will still have a single outcome variable; however unlike the correlation analysis you did before, this time you will have more than one predictor. Again, the full dataset has more than 1,800 variables so I'm going to constrain your choices; however, this time I'm giving you more freedom to select an outcome variable that most interests you.

Your __predictor__ variables will be at least two of the Big Five traits:

- Extraversion (V162333 & V162338)
- Agreeableness (V162334 & V162339)
- Conscientiousness (V162335 & V162340)
- Emotional stability^[This is generally referred to as *Neuroticism*, but the TIPI quantifies the trait such that higher scores indicate the inverse of neuroticism, i.e. emotional stability.] (V162336 & V162341)
- Openness (V162337 & V162342)


Your __outcome__ variable will be any one of the [feeling thermometer](https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2007ANES_Gallup_QuestionComparisons.pdf) questions. Here are all the subjects of feeling thermometer variables you can choose from:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(anesr)
library(tidyverse)
data("timeseries_2016_doc")

thermometers <- timeseries_2016_doc |> 
  # select(id, description) |> 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(tolower(description), "thermometer")) |> 
  select(description, id) |> 
  mutate(description = stringr::str_replace(description, regex(".*thermometer: ", ignore_case = TRUE), ""),
         description = stringr::str_to_title(description)) |> 
  mutate(li = glue::glue("<li>{description} ({toupper(id)})</li>")) |> 
  pull(li)


html_list <- paste0("<ul>", paste0(thermometers, collapse = ""), "</ul>")
```

`r html_list`



### Step 2. Find relevant research

As with Project 1, your approach and expectations should be informed by what has come before. Last time you didn't have so much choice of variables so I was able to point you to some relevant research. This time you have a wider choice so you'll have to find relevant research yourself about these (or related) personality traits. In particular, what psychological construct(s) do you think your feeling thermometer variable might reflect or relate to?

#### What to look for

A published, scholarly journal article detailing an empirical finding relevant to your variables of interest. This might be a paper reporting one or several individual studies that the researchers conducted, or it may be a review paper or meta-analysis.^[A meta-analysis pools the findings of many individual studies by different researchers into a single analysis.]

#### Where to look

##### [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)

Google Scholar searches the full text of scholarly articles. It casts a wide net, searching across all disciplines, and including books and other materials in addition to journal articles, so will likely find many articles not very relevant to the topic as well as those that are relevant.

##### [APA PsycINFO](http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?ALD2284)

The link above should take you to PsycINFO, a database for scholarly psychology research (you can also search for `psycinfo` in a CLIO quicksearch). PsycInfo gives you the ability to do more focused searching than Google Scholar.

-   You can add many keywords and combine them with the Boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` by selecting them from the dropdown boxes.
-   You can select where your keywords should appear, i.e. in the title, abstract, or full text of articles. Selecting `Word in Major Subject Heading` can help narrow down your search to articles that are actually on the topic you're interested in (rather than just containing the keyword).


### Step 3. Articulate your design and hypothesis

As before, you should be able to state your:

- __Operational definitions__ (that is, the specific questions that participants were asked, per the codebook)
- The __constructs__ that those operational definitions measure
- Your __hypotheses__

The hypotheses are formal statements of your expectations about how the predictors are associated with the outcome variable, and will be tested quantitatively by computing the regression model. The general hypothesis of a multiple regression is that there is a relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable; in other words, all the predictors combined allow us to predict scores on the outcome more accurately than you would expect if the predictors were unrelated to the outcome. This is referred to as the test of 'overall model fit'. You can also hypothesize about each individual predictor; you may expect some predictors to be more strongly predictive of the outcome variable than others, or you might even expect certain predictors to be unrelated to the outcome.
